Background Info:
John Maynard Keynes was a British economist whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments. He lived from 1883 to 1946. As the principal architect of Keynesian economics, his ideas focused on government intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions, depressions, and booms.

Keynes was born in Cambridge, England, into an academic family. He studied mathematics at Cambridge University before turning to economics. His early career was marked by his work in the Treasury during World War I, influencing the Versailles Treaty's economic aspects. Keynes gained prominence with his 1919 book "The Economic Consequences of the Peace," where he critiqued the punitive reparations imposed on Germany.

His most influential work, "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money," published during the Great Depression in 1936, challenged the then-dominant economic theories and introduced concepts like aggregate demand as the driver of the broader economy and the principle of government spending to stimulate demand and pull economies out of depression.

Keynes's ideas had a profound impact on modern economic and political theory as well as on fiscal policies of governments worldwide. He was also a part of the British delegation to the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, playing a significant role in the planning of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
