There are a few reasons to believe that the number of siblings someone has could be a good predictor of their future wages. First, people who come from larger families tend to have less access to resources like money and education. As a result, they may be less likely to get good jobs and earn high wages. Second, people from larger families are more likely to have to support their parents financially, which can lead to them being less able to invest in their own education and career. Finally, people from larger families are more likely to have to take care of their younger siblings, which can lead to them missing out on opportunities to develop important skills and knowledge.
Arg: Side.AGAINST


The use of number of siblings as an instrumental variable is not a valid way to measure the effect of education on wages. This is because the number of siblings is not a direct measure of education, but rather an indirect measure. Additionally, the number of siblings is not a static variable, but rather a dynamic one. This means that the number of siblings can change over time, which would impact the results of the study.

The argument that the number of siblings someone has could be a good predictor of their future wages is a reasonable one. The first reason given is that people who come from larger families tend to have less access to resources like money and education. This is a valid point, as it is likely that these individuals will have less opportunity to get good jobs and earn high wages. The second reason is that people from larger families are more likely to have to support their parents financially, which can lead to them being less able to invest in their own education and career. This is also a valid point, as it is likely that these individuals will have less opportunity to invest in their own future.

Number of siblings is not a valid instrumental variable for the purpose of investigating the relationship between education and wages. There are a number of reasons why this is the case.

First, the number of siblings someone has is not likely to be a good proxy for the amount of education they receive. There is a lot of variation in the number of siblings people have, and it is not clear that this variation is related to differences in educational attainment.

Number of siblings should not be used as an instrumental variable in this instance because it is not a direct causal factor of education. Although number of siblings may be indirectly related to education (for example, if parents have more children they may have less money to spend on each child's education), this is not a strong enough connection to be used as a reliable predictor of wages. Furthermore, there are other factors (such as family income and parents' education levels) that are more directly related to both education and wages, and so should be given more weight when considering this question.

Many people believe that an increase in years of secondary schooling causes an increase in wages. However, there is no definitive evidence to support this claim. While some studies suggest that there is a positive correlation between education and wages, other studies find no significant relationship.

One reason why it is difficult to determine the effect of education on wages is that there are many other factors that affect earnings. For example, people with more years of schooling may also have better job opportunities and be more likely to work in higher-paying occupations.

It is also difficult to isolate the effect of education on wages because people who choose to invest in more years of schooling may also have other characteristics that lead to higher earnings. For example, they may be more ambitious or have more family resources.

However, one way to try to isolate the effect of education on wages is to use an instrumental variable. An instrumental variable is a variable that is not affected by the other factors that affect earnings, but is still related to education.

There are a few reasons to believe that tuition costs could be a helpful instrumental variable in this case. First, tuition costs are a good proxy for years of schooling. They are highly correlated with years of schooling, meaning that they can be used as a stand-in for years of schooling in our analysis. Second, tuition costs are less likely to be affected by other factors that could affect wages, such as experience or job type. This means that we can be more confident that the relationship we observe between tuition costs and wages is causal.

Third, tuition costs are a relatively easily measured variable, which makes them more practical to use in our analysis. And fourth, using tuition costs as an instrumental variable is likely to provide us with more accurate results than using years of schooling as a direct measure of educational attainment. This is because there is more variability in the number of years of schooling people have than in the amount of tuition they pay.

In sum, using tuition costs as an instrumental variable is a sound and sensible approach that is likely to yield accurate and reliable results.
Arg: Side.AGAINST


When considering whether or not tuition costs can be used as an instrumental variable in order to determine the effect of an increase in years of secondary schooling on wages, one must first consider the potential endogeneity of the tuition variable. Endogeneity in this context means that tuition could be influenced by the same factors that influence wages, which would in turn lead to an overestimation of the effect of schooling on wages. For example, if families with higher incomes are able to better afford tuition, then this would lead to an overestimation of the effect of schooling on wages.

Instrumental variables must be exogenous, which means that they cannot be affected by the same factors that affect the dependent variable. In this case, if tuition is endogeneous, then it cannot be used as an instrument for schooling.

There are a number of other potential problems with using tuition as an instrument for schooling. First, tuition may not be a good proxy for years of schooling. Families may choose to send their children to private schools for a number of reasons, including religious or philosophical reasons, that have nothing to do with the quality of education.

The reason that tuition costs can be used as an instrumental variable in this instance is because it is a good proxy for education. Tuition costs are a good predictor of how much education someone has, and as such, can be used to predict wages.

Therefore, if we want to predict wages, using tuition costs as an instrumental variable is a good way to do it.

Therefore, using Number of siblings. as an Instrumental Variable would not isolate the effect of education on wages, and as such would provide an inaccurate estimate of the causal effect.


The argument is reasonable, but it is not clear how well number of siblings would proxy for the amount of resources each child has access to. If the goal is to control for confounding factors, using number of siblings as an IV may not be the best option.

There are a few reasons to believe that number of siblings would be a good instrumental variable in this context. First, sibling number is likely to be correlated with years of schooling. That is, people who come from larger families are often forced to drop out of school earlier to help support their families, or they may have to take on more family responsibilities, which can interfere with their schooling. Second, sibling number is likely to be correlated with earnings. That is, people from larger families often have lower earnings because they have to share their earnings with their families. Third, sibling number is likely to be correlated with other factors that affect wages, such as family size, parental education, and regional economic conditions. fourth, sibling number is likely to be correlated with the number of years of schooling. That is, people from larger families often have to drop out of school earlier to help support their families, or they may have to take on more family responsibilities, which can interfere with their schooling.

The idea that using number of siblings as an instrumental variable in order to study the relationship between education and wages is flawed for a number of reasons. First, the assumption that number of siblings is exogenous to education is simply not true. It is likely that the number of siblings a person has is at least partially determined by their parents' education level, which means that it is not a true control variable. Second, even if we could assume that number of siblings was exogenous, it is not a good proxy for education. The two variables are not perfectly correlated, which means that using number of siblings as a control variable would introduce error into the analysis.

The argument is not particularly strong, but it is not entirely without merit. The idea that sibling number could be used as an instrumental variable in this context is not unreasonable, and the argument does provide some evidence to support this idea. However, the argument is not particularly strong, and it does not provide a great deal of evidence to support the idea that sibling number would be a good instrumental variable.


The argument presented is not particularly strong. The first point, that the number of siblings a person has is at least partially determined by their parents' education level, is a valid one. However, the second point, that number of siblings is not a good proxy for education, is not as strong. The two variables are not perfectly correlated, but they are still correlated. This means that using number of siblings as a control variable would not introduce as much error into the analysis as the author suggests.

An increase in years of secondary schooling does indeed lead to an increase in wages. However, the use of siblings as an instrumental variable creates a more complex picture. The number of siblings a person has is positively correlated with their schooling, but it is also correlated with their family's economic status. Therefore, using siblings as an instrumental variable would lead to an overestimation of the impact of schooling on wages.

The high school graduation rate is a good indicator of the number of years of secondary schooling. It is a positive sign for the labor market when the high school graduation rate is high.

There are a number of problems with using the high school graduation rate as an instrumental variable in this context. First, it is not clear that the graduation rate is a good proxy for years of secondary schooling. It is possible that some students who do not graduate still receive a significant amount of education, while some students who do graduate have not received much education. Second, even if the graduation rate is a good proxy for years of schooling, it is not clear that it is a good predictor of wages. It is possible that graduates earn more because they are better educated, but it is also possible that they earn more because they are more likely to come from higher-income families or because they are more likely to have better-paying jobs. Finally, there is also the potential for reverse causality, as it is possible that people who earn more are more likely to stay in school longer.

An increase in the high school graduation rate will lead to an increase in wages. This is because those who graduate from high school will have the skills and knowledge necessary to be productive members of the workforce. Additionally, high school graduates will have the opportunity to pursue higher education, which will lead to even higher wages. Therefore, the high school graduation rate is a good predictor of future wage growth.

The high school graduation rate is not a valid instrumental variable for the purpose of determining the causal effect of education on wages. The graduation rate is not a measure of the amount of education an individual has, but rather a measure of whether or not an individual has completed high school. Furthermore, the graduation rate is likely to be confounded with other factors that affect both graduation rates and wages.

There are a few key reasons why using the high school graduation rate as an instrumental variable makes sense when studying the relationship between education and wages. First, the graduation rate is a good proxy for the level of education someone has attained. Second, the graduation rate is not likely to be affected by other factors that could influence wages, such as experience or job type. Finally, the high school graduation rate is a widely available data point, making it easy to use in research.

When it comes to the relationship between education and wages, the high school graduation rate is a good indicator of the level of education someone has attained. This is important because education is one of the key determinants of earnings. Individuals with more education tend to earn more than those with less education. The high school graduation rate is a good proxy for the level of education someone has attained because it is a measure of how many people have completed high school.
